          <p>　　MY BACKGROUND</p>
          <p>　　I was born in a small village of Shan Dong Province on April 4th, 1968.   When I was young, my family was very poor, so I had to work to earn money to   help my parents after class when I was in the middle school.</p>
          <p>　　In 1986 I was admitted by University of International Business and   Economics (or: UIBE) to pursue a bachelor degree in Economics. My major is   accounting in Department of International Business Management. The undergraduate   education gave me a wide range of vision and taught me how to cooperate with   others. I developed several professional interests in Accounting, Finance, and   International Trade.</p>
          <p>　　The following eight-year working experience offered me a good chance to   give full play to my creativity, intelligence and diligence. In 1990-1993, I   worked as an assistant to funding manager in China National Technical Import and   Export Corporation. In 1993-present, I was employed by China Kingdom Import and   Export Corporation to be the Manger of Financial and Accounting Division.</p>
          <p>　　I do believe that with my hard early life, solid educational background and   ample working experience, I would be an excellent student of you MBA   program.</p>
          <p>　　MY PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT:</p>
          <p>　　After graduating from UIBE, I was employed as the assistant to the funding   manager by China National Technical Import and Export Corporation. After reading   a lot of related files, and analyzing the overall funding situation of the   corporation, I found that the loan policy was not been put into effect. So we   have thousands of millions RMB loan with very high interest rate while a large   amount of cash in bank with very low interest rate was idle. I reported this to   my supervisor, and then we studied and revised the loan policy. This revision   saved the corporation approximately RMB thirty millions yuan. In order to raise   the funding effectiveness, after one year’s hard work, I developed the internal   banking system within the corporation based on the actual funding supply and   need of the different divisions and projects. This internal banking system made   full use of the corporation’ funding resources, and due to this, I was highly   praised by the president of the corporation.</p>
          <p>　　WHY CHOOSE YOUR MBA PROGRAM?</p>
          <p>　　After I have worked in business area for eight years, I feel that I need to   continue my education by pursuing a Master degree in business administration. I   have practiced my professional expertise in accounting, demonstrated my   leadership abilities and perfected my communication skills. But I have yet to   become an entrepreneur in my own right, and to fully master the art of modern   business. I want to be trained more vigorously in scientific methods of analysis   and synthesis. There are a lot of opportunities and challenges in China that I   do not yet fell fully confident to seize. My business career has so far   benefited mostly the companies that I worked for, but a good business education   in your university will probably become a new era for me.</p>
          <p>　　Your university is well known for its excellence in China’s business   education. I am sure that, with my extensive business experience, I can be a   worthy student of yours. I am anxious to benefit from your seasoned guidance and   take advantage of your research facilities.</p>
