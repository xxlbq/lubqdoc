I have worked at  ZhiLong software(ShenYang) more than one year and livedoor software (DaLian) Co.Ltd from 2005 Sep to now.
Within that, I have accumulated strong experience in java web development  In the projects, every day, 
I am facing with new tasks arranged by group leader, which are delivered from Japanese customer.
 I make program using Java language. 
 and manager code to control the job, but the most important work I should deal with is the testing 
which is based on mysql . I need make huge of data from database for the program.

At my free time, I keep on studying  English. 
Not only studied at work, but also be free.
 I think that an excellent technical engineer should not be a man who just knows some technology deeply; 
they should improve themselves extensively. Language skill, communication, 
coordination and the teamwork spirit are also the most important factors.

I think I am man with the characters of initiative, confidence and perseverance. 
I would appreciate it if you could give me a chance or even a little time. I will keep on working hard and create more values.
