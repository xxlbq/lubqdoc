¢ó. Answer the question
What changes took place during the Industrial Revolution? What was the impact of the 
Industrial Revolution on English society?
In the early 1800s a group calling themselves Luddites (after Ned Ludd, one of the first 
violent protesters) smashed and destroyed new factory machinery in the Midlands and 
north. As craftsmen who traditionally worked at home, the Luddites were protesting that 
factory machines had robbed them of their livelihood. A modern parallel occurred in 1979 
when printers working for The Times newspaper group objected to proposals for increased 
mechanization which would have made many of them redundant. They did not smash machinery 
but went on strike, forcing The Times to suspend publication for almost a year before an 
agreement was reached.
