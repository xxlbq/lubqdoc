¢ò. Explain the following in English
1.Hollywood

No institution has ever before been such an instrument 
for conveying images and myths about any one country to every corner of the world. There 
must be few people anywhere who have not seen America¡¯s past and present represented in 
films and television serials. The picture may be partly false or misleading, with too 
much emphasis on crime and violence but however much one may criticize the mass media of 
entertainment, it is appropriate that they started in California and have grown up with 
it. Hollywood has a good claim to interpret America to the world, because it is in the 
place where all American civilization in distilled into an image of its own destiny. 

2.Federalism  
The Federal government at Washington is concerned with foreign affairs and with matters 
of general concern to all the states including commerce between the states. It also has 
three elements-executive (the President), legislature (Congress) and judicial, and the 
three elements are checked and balanced by one another.

3.the US Constitution
The President as a replacement for the English king, and did not expect any President 
to resign, though the old device of impeachment was available for Congress to remove a 
President by a special kind of political trial. It includes the State Constitutions and 
the Federal Constitution.
